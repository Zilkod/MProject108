With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic “No CAPTCHA” followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.

      "description": "Rendering performance is all about how fast you can draw your activity, and get it updated on the screen. Success here means your users feeling like your application is smooth and responsive, which means that you’ve got to get all your logic completed, _and_ all your rendering done in 16ms or less, each and every frame. But that might be a bit more difficult than you think. In this talk,we will take a look at what “rendering performance” means, alongside some of the most common pitfalls that are ran into; and let’s not forget the important stuff: the tools that help you track down, and fix these issues before they become large problems. (Note: This Sandbox talk will be offered twice throughout the event. Check the schedule to confirm timings.)",

Virtual reality introduces a new set of physiological and ergonomic considerations to your design work. Additionally, as a new medium users may not have established a familiarity with interacting with virtual reality applications yet. And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the user’s focus and attention. We’ll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well. We'll also discuss best practices for rapid prototyping in virtual reality, and what the Google VR design team has learned from crafting virtual reality applications.",

He’ll explain why failure is so important to the innovation process at Google[x], and how we relentlessly seek out contact with the harsh realities of weather, physics, humanity, and much more, because so much of what we have to learn can’t be predicted by a book, taught in school or observed in a lab.

If you want to do anything with it, there's always those first few steps of getting it out and waking it up. Android Wear’s new platform feature, always-on, allows you to stay in an app for as long as you need it. This transforms the watch into whatever app you happen to be using: a map, a shopping list, a fitness coach – the possibilities are endless. In this session, you'll learn how to design and build for the new capabilities and opportunities that always-on screens provide.",

In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic “No CAPTCHA” followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.

Project Loon balloons float in the stratosphere, twice as high as airplanes and most weather events, forming a mesh network in the sky. Users can connect to the internet from the balloon network through their handheld devices as the balloons fly overhead.\n\nThis talk will present the vision, the history, and the technology behind Project Loon.",

With nearly unlimited resources of the cloud and significant automation, this is achievable for even the most constrained app development teams. \nWant to access the latest (and old) Android and iOS devices that your app might need to run on? Wish you could run hundreds of tests in parallel on every combination for every commit? Want to improve quality without even writing tests? Join us to see how all three can be achieved. We will use a Google Cloud test service to illustrate some of the key practices that you can incorporate in your app development. (Note: This Sandbox talk will be offered twice throughout the event.
