              <p>If you're joining us in person at Moscone West, here are some useful tips to navigate your way through the conference:</p>

              </ul>

              <h5 id="badges">Badges &amp; badge pick-up</h5>

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Google takes these violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

              <p>Google reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from Google I/O (including future Google I/O events) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes but is not limited to attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with the terms and conditions herein.</p>

              <h5 id="communitytips">Community Tips for I/O</h5>
              <p>Be excellent to each other. We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, differing abilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, age or religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn't demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.</p>
              <p>Speak up if you see or hear something. You are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately.</p>
              <p>Practice saying "Yes and" to each other. Build on each other's ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</p>
